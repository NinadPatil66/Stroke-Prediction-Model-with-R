# Stroke-Prediction-Model-with-R
## Background Research about the Project:
Tidymodels has been gradually emerging as the tidyverseâ€™s machine learning toolkit. R has a consistency problem. Since everything was made by different people and using different principles, everything has a slightly different interface, and trying to keep everything in line can be frustrating. Caret R package (see my caret tutorial) aimed at creating a uniform interface for the massive variety of machine learning models that exist in R. Caret was great in a lot of ways, but also it is quite slow whenever I tried to use on problems of any kind of modest size.
